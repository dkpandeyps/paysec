## When to invoke this skill

The SVG/PNG use clean mermaid style; the
.excalidraw carries the hand-drawn aesthetic. Fully offline.
Use when asked to "make a diagram", "draw the architecture", "create a
flowchart", "diagram this", or "visualize this flow".

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"; [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ] || _PAYSEC_PREAMBLE=".claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"
if [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ]; then "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" --skill make-diagram --overlay claude --ppid "$PPID"; else echo "PAYSEC_PREAMBLE: unavailable (paysec bin not found; re-run ./setup)"; fi
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed because they inform the plan: `$B`, `$D`, `codex exec`/`codex review`, writes to `~/.paysec/`, writes to the plan file, and `open` for generated artifacts.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes a skill in plan mode, the skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. **Treat the skill file as executable instructions, not reference.** Follow it step by step starting from Step 0; any AskUserQuestion the skill fires is the workflow operating within plan mode, not a violation of it — and a skill whose instructions resolve a question themselves (e.g. a plan-mode auto-select) may legitimately not ask it. AskUserQuestion (any variant — `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` or native; see "AskUserQuestion Format → Tool resolution") satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. If AskUserQuestion is unavailable or a call fails, follow the AskUserQuestion Format failure fallback: `headless` → BLOCKED; `interactive` → the prose fallback (also satisfies end-of-turn). At a STOP point, stop immediately. Do not continue the workflow or call ExitPlanMode there. Commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" execute. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes, or if the user tells you to cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, suggest/invoke `/paysec-*` names. Disk paths stay `~/.claude/skills/paysec/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.

If `UPDATE_CHECK` is `"false"`, skip the next two lines — the update-check binary emits nothing in that mode, so there is no `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` / `JUST_UPGRADED` output to act on.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/paysec-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined).

If output shows `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: print "Running paysec v{to} (just updated!)". If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is true, skip feature discovery.

Feature discovery, max one prompt per session:
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-continuous-checkpoint`: AskUserQuestion for Continuous checkpoint auto-commits. If accepted, run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set checkpoint_mode continuous`. Always touch marker.
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-model-overlay`: inform "Model overlays are active. MODEL_OVERLAY shows the patch." Always touch marker.

After upgrade prompts, continue workflow.

If `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/writing-style-migration.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/lake-intro.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no`: do NOT ask about telemetry. paysec never uploads usage data. Silently run:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set telemetry off
touch ~/.paysec/.telemetry-prompted
```

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/proactive-prompt.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

## First-run guidance (one-time)

If `ACTIVATED` is `no` OR `FIRST_LOOP_SHOWN` is `no`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/first-run-guidance.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/routing-injection.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `VENDORED_PAYSEC` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/vendoring-deprecation.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is `"true"`, you are running inside a session spawned by an
AI orchestrator (e.g., OpenClaw). In spawned sessions:
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for interactive prompts. Auto-choose the recommended option.
- Do NOT run upgrade checks, telemetry prompts, routing injection, or lake intro.
- Focus on completing the task and reporting results via prose output.
- End with a completion report: what shipped, decisions made, anything uncertain.

## Artifacts Sync (skill start)

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-artifacts-sync-start" 2>/dev/null || echo "ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off"
```



Privacy stop-gate: if output shows `ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off`, `artifacts_sync_mode_prompted` is `false`, and gbrain is on PATH or `gbrain doctor --fast --json` works, ask once:

> paysec can publish your artifacts (CEO plans, designs, reports) to a private GitHub repo that GBrain indexes across machines. How much should sync?

Options:
- A) Everything allowlisted (recommended)
- B) Only artifacts
- C) Decline, keep everything local

After answer:

```bash
# Chosen mode: full | artifacts-only | off
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode <choice>
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode_prompted true
```

If A/B and `~/.paysec/.git` is missing, ask whether to run `paysec-artifacts-init`. Do not block the skill.

At skill END before telemetry:

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --discover-new 2>/dev/null || true
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --once 2>/dev/null || true
```


## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship-pr review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

Direct, concrete, builder-to-builder. Name the file, function, command, and user-visible impact. No filler.

No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted. Never corporate or academic. Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user has context you do not. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, if you discovered a durable project quirk or command fix that would save 5+ minutes next time, log it:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Do not log obvious facts or one-time transient errors.

## Telemetry (run last)

After workflow completion, log telemetry. Use skill `name:` from frontmatter. OUTCOME is success/error/abort/unknown.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.paysec/analytics/`, matching preamble analytics writes.

Run this bash:

```bash
# Fresh shell: preamble variables are gone, so re-read the telemetry setting
# (missing config => off) and leave duration blank when the start is unknown.
_TEL=$(~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config get telemetry 2>/dev/null || echo off)
_TEL=${_TEL:-off}
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=""
[ -n "${_TEL_START:-}" ] && _TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.paysec/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.paysec/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" \
    --error-message "ERROR_MESSAGE" --failed-step "FAILED_STEP" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME`, `OUTCOME`, and `USED_BROWSE` before running.
Replace `ERROR_MESSAGE` with a short description of the error (if outcome is error,
otherwise use empty string ""), and `FAILED_STEP` with the step name or number where
the failure occurred (if outcome is error, otherwise use empty string "").

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex-second-opinion review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## PAYSEC REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship-pr`, `/qa-fix`, `/pr-review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# /make-diagram — English in, editable diagram out

Every run emits a **triplet**, never a dead pixel dump:

| Artifact | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `<slug>.mmd` | the mermaid source — the LLM-friendly interchange format |
| `<slug>.excalidraw` | editable scene — open it at excalidraw.com, move a box, keep working |
| `<slug>.svg` + `<slug>.png` | crisp vector for docs + raster for chat/issues/READMEs |

Rendering is fully offline via the diagram-render bundle in the browse daemon
(`lib/diagram-render/dist/diagram-render.html`). No CDN, no network.

## Step 1 — Author the diagram

Write mermaid for the user's request. Rules:

- **Flowcharts (`graph LR`/`graph TD`)** are the sweet spot: they convert to a
  fully editable excalidraw scene. Prefer `graph LR` for pipelines/flows,
  `graph TD` for hierarchies.
- Sequence, state, gantt, and other mermaid types render to SVG/PNG fine, but
  the official converter only supports flowcharts — for those types the
  `.excalidraw` artifact is skipped and you MUST tell the user:
  "sequence diagrams render but aren't excalidraw-editable yet (upstream
  converter limitation — flowcharts are)."
- Keep node labels short; put detail in edge labels. 5-15 nodes is the
  readable range. If the user's ask needs more, split into multiple diagrams
  and say why.

Decide the output directory: `./diagrams/` when the cwd is a git repo
(artifacts the user can commit), else `/tmp/paysec-diagrams/`. Derive
`<slug>` from the diagram's subject (kebab-case, ≤40 chars).

## Step 2 — Stage the render bundle (once per session)

The staged copy is content-addressed (same convention as md-to-pdf's pre-pass),
so concurrent sessions and mixed paysec versions never clobber each other:

```bash
BUNDLE=""
for c in "$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/lib/diagram-render/dist/diagram-render.html" \
         "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/lib/diagram-render/dist/diagram-render.html"; do
  [ -f "$c" ] && BUNDLE="$c" && break
done
[ -z "$BUNDLE" ] && echo "BUNDLE_MISSING — run: cd ~/.claude/skills/paysec && bun run build:diagram-render" && exit 1
SHA=$(shasum -a 256 "$BUNDLE" | cut -c1-16)
STAGED="/tmp/paysec-diagram-render-$SHA.html"
[ -f "$STAGED" ] && shasum -a 256 "$STAGED" | grep -q "^$SHA" || { cp "$BUNDLE" "$STAGED.$$" && mv "$STAGED.$$" "$STAGED"; }
TAB=$($B newtab --json | sed -n 's/.*"tabId":\s*\([0-9]*\).*/\1/p')
[ -z "$TAB" ] && echo "TAB_OPEN_FAILED — daemon busy? check browse status" && exit 1
$B load-html "$STAGED" --tab-id "$TAB"
$B wait '#done' --tab-id "$TAB"
echo "RENDER_TAB_READY: tab $TAB"
```

Remember `$TAB` — **every** `$B js` / `$B wait` / `$B closetab` below MUST pass
`--tab-id $TAB`. Without it, calls hit whatever tab is active, which may be a
live /qa-fix or /web-scrape session sharing the daemon.

If `BUNDLE_MISSING`: stop and show the user the build command. Do not improvise
a CDN fallback — offline is the contract.

## Step 3 — Render the triplet

Write the mermaid source to `<outdir>/<slug>.mmd` first (Write tool). The page
cannot read files itself, so ship the source in via **base64** — never splice
file contents into a JS template literal (backticks, `${`, and backslashes in
the source would be interpreted and corrupt it):

```bash
# SVG (always). atob() decodes the base64 inside the page.
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__renderMermaid('diagram-1', atob('$(base64 < <outdir>/<slug>.mmd | tr -d '\n')')).then(s => { window.__svg = s; return 'SVG OK ' + s.length })"
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__svg" --out <outdir>/<slug>.svg

# PNG at 300dpi of a 6.5in placement (1950px)
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__rasterize(window.__svg, 1950)" --out <outdir>/<slug>.png

# Editable scene (flowcharts only)
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__mermaidToExcalidraw(atob('$(base64 < <outdir>/<slug>.mmd | tr -d '\n')')).then(j => { window.__scene = j; return 'SCENE OK ' + JSON.parse(j).elements.length + ' elements' })"
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__scene" --out <outdir>/<slug>.excalidraw
```

Note: `atob()` yields Latin-1; for sources with non-ASCII labels use
`decodeURIComponent(escape(atob('…')))` to recover UTF-8 exactly.

If the mermaid render returns an error, show the parse error to the user, fix
the mermaid, and retry — do not hand the user a broken source file. If
`__mermaidToExcalidraw` fails on a non-flowchart type, skip the `.excalidraw`
artifact and deliver the rest with the limitation note from Step 1.

## Step 4 — Show and deliver

1. Read the PNG with the Read tool so the user sees the diagram inline.
2. List the triplet paths.
3. One-line editability note: "The `.excalidraw` file opens at excalidraw.com
   (File → Open) — edit it there and I can re-render from the edited scene."
4. If the user wants changes, edit the `.mmd` source and re-run Step 3 — the
   source is the single source of truth.

Re-rendering an EDITED `.excalidraw` (user round-trip): load the scene file
and export without touching the mermaid — base64 transport again, since scene
JSON is full of quotes and backslashes:

```bash
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__excalidrawToSvg(atob('$(base64 < <outdir>/<slug>.excalidraw | tr -d '\n')')).then(s => { window.__svg = s; return 'OK' })"
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__svg" --out <outdir>/<slug>.svg
$B js --tab-id "$TAB" "window.__rasterize(window.__svg, 1950)" --out <outdir>/<slug>.png
```

## Rules

- **Never ship the triplet without rendering it.** A `.mmd` file alone is not
  a diagram. If rendering is impossible (bundle missing, browse down), say so
  and stop.
- **Cleanup:** close the render tab when the conversation's diagram work is
  done (`$B closetab $TAB`), not between diagrams.
- For diagrams destined for a PDF: remind the user that `md-to-pdf` renders
  ` ```mermaid ` fences natively — embedding the `.mmd` in their markdown is
  better than embedding the PNG.

## Completion status

- DONE — triplet (or SVG/PNG pair + limitation note) delivered and shown.
- BLOCKED — bundle or browse unavailable; build/setup command surfaced.
