## When to invoke this skill

Runs the same prompt through Claude,
GPT (via Codex CLI), and Gemini side-by-side — compares latency, tokens, cost,
and optionally quality via LLM judge. Answers "which model is actually best
for this skill?" with data instead of vibes. Separate from /perf-check, which
measures web page performance. Use when: "benchmark models", "compare models",
"which model is best for X", "cross-model comparison", "model shootout".

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "compare models", "model shootout", "which model is best".

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"; [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ] || _PAYSEC_PREAMBLE=".claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"
if [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ]; then "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" --skill model-benchmark --overlay claude --ppid "$PPID"; else echo "PAYSEC_PREAMBLE: unavailable (paysec bin not found; re-run ./setup)"; fi
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed because they inform the plan: `$B`, `$D`, `codex exec`/`codex review`, writes to `~/.paysec/`, writes to the plan file, and `open` for generated artifacts.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes a skill in plan mode, the skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. **Treat the skill file as executable instructions, not reference.** Follow it step by step starting from Step 0; any AskUserQuestion the skill fires is the workflow operating within plan mode, not a violation of it — and a skill whose instructions resolve a question themselves (e.g. a plan-mode auto-select) may legitimately not ask it. AskUserQuestion (any variant — `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` or native; see "AskUserQuestion Format → Tool resolution") satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. If AskUserQuestion is unavailable or a call fails, follow the AskUserQuestion Format failure fallback: `headless` → BLOCKED; `interactive` → the prose fallback (also satisfies end-of-turn). At a STOP point, stop immediately. Do not continue the workflow or call ExitPlanMode there. Commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" execute. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes, or if the user tells you to cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, suggest/invoke `/paysec-*` names. Disk paths stay `~/.claude/skills/paysec/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.

If `UPDATE_CHECK` is `"false"`, skip the next two lines — the update-check binary emits nothing in that mode, so there is no `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` / `JUST_UPGRADED` output to act on.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/paysec-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined).

If output shows `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: print "Running paysec v{to} (just updated!)". If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is true, skip feature discovery.

Feature discovery, max one prompt per session:
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-continuous-checkpoint`: AskUserQuestion for Continuous checkpoint auto-commits. If accepted, run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set checkpoint_mode continuous`. Always touch marker.
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-model-overlay`: inform "Model overlays are active. MODEL_OVERLAY shows the patch." Always touch marker.

After upgrade prompts, continue workflow.

If `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/writing-style-migration.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/lake-intro.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no`: do NOT ask about telemetry. paysec never uploads usage data. Silently run:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set telemetry off
touch ~/.paysec/.telemetry-prompted
```

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/proactive-prompt.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

## First-run guidance (one-time)

If `ACTIVATED` is `no` OR `FIRST_LOOP_SHOWN` is `no`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/first-run-guidance.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/routing-injection.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `VENDORED_PAYSEC` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/vendoring-deprecation.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is `"true"`, you are running inside a session spawned by an
AI orchestrator (e.g., OpenClaw). In spawned sessions:
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for interactive prompts. Auto-choose the recommended option.
- Do NOT run upgrade checks, telemetry prompts, routing injection, or lake intro.
- Focus on completing the task and reporting results via prose output.
- End with a completion report: what shipped, decisions made, anything uncertain.

## Artifacts Sync (skill start)

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-artifacts-sync-start" 2>/dev/null || echo "ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off"
```



Privacy stop-gate: if output shows `ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off`, `artifacts_sync_mode_prompted` is `false`, and gbrain is on PATH or `gbrain doctor --fast --json` works, ask once:

> paysec can publish your artifacts (CEO plans, designs, reports) to a private GitHub repo that GBrain indexes across machines. How much should sync?

Options:
- A) Everything allowlisted (recommended)
- B) Only artifacts
- C) Decline, keep everything local

After answer:

```bash
# Chosen mode: full | artifacts-only | off
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode <choice>
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode_prompted true
```

If A/B and `~/.paysec/.git` is missing, ask whether to run `paysec-artifacts-init`. Do not block the skill.

At skill END before telemetry:

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --discover-new 2>/dev/null || true
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --once 2>/dev/null || true
```


## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship-pr review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

Direct, concrete, builder-to-builder. Name the file, function, command, and user-visible impact. No filler.

No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted. Never corporate or academic. Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user has context you do not. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, if you discovered a durable project quirk or command fix that would save 5+ minutes next time, log it:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Do not log obvious facts or one-time transient errors.

## Telemetry (run last)

After workflow completion, log telemetry. Use skill `name:` from frontmatter. OUTCOME is success/error/abort/unknown.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.paysec/analytics/`, matching preamble analytics writes.

Run this bash:

```bash
# Fresh shell: preamble variables are gone, so re-read the telemetry setting
# (missing config => off) and leave duration blank when the start is unknown.
_TEL=$(~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config get telemetry 2>/dev/null || echo off)
_TEL=${_TEL:-off}
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=""
[ -n "${_TEL_START:-}" ] && _TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.paysec/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.paysec/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" \
    --error-message "ERROR_MESSAGE" --failed-step "FAILED_STEP" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME`, `OUTCOME`, and `USED_BROWSE` before running.
Replace `ERROR_MESSAGE` with a short description of the error (if outcome is error,
otherwise use empty string ""), and `FAILED_STEP` with the step name or number where
the failure occurred (if outcome is error, otherwise use empty string "").

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex-second-opinion review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## PAYSEC REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship-pr`, `/qa-fix`, `/pr-review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# /model-benchmark — Cross-Model Skill Benchmark

You are running the `/model-benchmark` workflow. Wraps the `paysec-model-benchmark` binary with an interactive flow that picks a prompt, confirms providers, previews auth, and runs the benchmark.

Different from `/perf-check` — that skill measures web page performance (Core Web Vitals, load times). This skill measures AI model performance on paysec skills or arbitrary prompts.

---

## Step 0: Locate the binary

```bash
BIN="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-model-benchmark"
[ -x "$BIN" ] || BIN=".claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-model-benchmark"
[ -x "$BIN" ] || { echo "ERROR: paysec-model-benchmark not found. Run ./setup in the paysec install dir." >&2; exit 1; }
echo "BIN: $BIN"
```

If not found, stop and tell the user to reinstall paysec.

---

## Step 1: Choose a prompt

Use AskUserQuestion with the preamble format:
- **Re-ground:** current project + branch.
- **Simplify:** "A cross-model benchmark runs the same prompt through 2-3 AI models and shows you how they compare on speed, cost, and output quality. What prompt should we use?"
- **RECOMMENDATION:** A because benchmarking against a real skill exposes tool-use differences, not just raw generation.
- **Options:**
  - A) Benchmark one of my paysec skills (we'll pick which skill next). Completeness: 10/10.
  - B) Use an inline prompt — type it on the next turn. Completeness: 8/10.
  - C) Point at a prompt file on disk — specify path on the next turn. Completeness: 8/10.

If A: list top-level paysec skills that have SKILL.md files (from `find . -maxdepth 2 -name SKILL.md -not -path './.*'`), ask the user to pick one via a second AskUserQuestion. Use the picked SKILL.md path as the prompt file.

If B: ask the user for the inline prompt. Use it verbatim via `--prompt "<text>"`.

If C: ask for the path. Verify it exists. Use as positional argument.

---

## Step 2: Choose providers

```bash
"$BIN" --prompt "unused, dry-run" --models claude,gpt,gemini --dry-run
```

Show the dry-run output. The "Adapter availability" section tells the user which providers will actually run (OK) vs skip (NOT READY — remediation hint included).

If ALL three show NOT READY: stop with a clear message — benchmark can't run without at least one authed provider. Suggest `claude login`, `codex login`, or `gemini login` / `export GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

If at least one is OK: AskUserQuestion:
- **Simplify:** "Which models should we include? The dry-run above showed which are authed. Unauthed ones will be skipped cleanly — they won't abort the batch."
- **RECOMMENDATION:** A (all authed providers) because running as many as possible gives the richest comparison.
- **Options:**
  - A) All authed providers. Completeness: 10/10.
  - B) Only Claude. Completeness: 6/10 (no cross-model signal — use /ship-pr's review for solo claude benchmarks instead).
  - C) Pick two — specify on next turn. Completeness: 8/10.

---

## Step 3: Decide on judge

```bash
[ -n "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" ] || grep -q 'ANTHROPIC' "$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json" 2>/dev/null && echo "JUDGE_AVAILABLE" || echo "JUDGE_UNAVAILABLE"
```

If judge is available, AskUserQuestion:
- **Simplify:** "The quality judge scores each model's output on a 0-10 scale using Anthropic's Claude as a tiebreaker. Adds ~$0.05/run. Recommended if you care about output quality, not just latency and cost."
- **RECOMMENDATION:** A — the whole point is comparing quality, not just speed.
- **Options:**
  - A) Enable judge (adds ~$0.05). Completeness: 10/10.
  - B) Skip judge — speed/cost/tokens only. Completeness: 7/10.

If judge is NOT available, skip this question and omit the `--judge` flag.

---

## Step 4: Run the benchmark

Construct the command from Step 1, 2, 3 decisions:

```bash
"$BIN" <prompt-spec> --models <picked-models> [--judge] --output table
```

Where `<prompt-spec>` is either `--prompt "<text>"` (Step 1B), a file path (Step 1A or 1C), and `<picked-models>` is the comma-separated list from Step 2.

Stream the output as it arrives. This is slow — each provider runs the prompt fully. Expect 30s-5min depending on prompt complexity and whether `--judge` is on.

---

## Step 5: Interpret results

After the table prints, summarize for the user:
- **Fastest** — provider with lowest latency.
- **Cheapest** — provider with lowest cost.
- **Highest quality** (if `--judge` ran) — provider with highest score.
- **Best overall** — use judgment. If judge ran: quality-weighted. Otherwise: note the tradeoff the user needs to make.

If any provider hit an error (auth/timeout/rate_limit), call it out with the remediation path.

---

## Step 6: Offer to save results

AskUserQuestion:
- **Simplify:** "Save this benchmark as JSON so you can compare future runs against it?"
- **RECOMMENDATION:** A — skill performance drifts as providers update their models; a saved baseline catches quality regressions.
- **Options:**
  - A) Save to `~/.paysec/benchmarks/<date>-<skill-or-prompt-slug>.json`. Completeness: 10/10.
  - B) Just print, don't save. Completeness: 5/10 (loses trend data).

If A: re-run with `--output json` and tee to the dated file. Print the path so the user can diff future runs against it.

---

## Important Rules

- **Never run a real benchmark without Step 2's dry-run first.** Users need to see auth status before spending API calls.
- **Never hardcode model names.** Always pass providers from user's Step 2 choice — the binary handles the rest.
- **Never auto-include `--judge`.** It adds real cost; user must opt in.
- **If zero providers are authed, STOP.** Don't attempt the benchmark — it produces no useful output.
- **Cost is visible.** Every run shows per-provider cost in the table. Users should see it before the next run.
