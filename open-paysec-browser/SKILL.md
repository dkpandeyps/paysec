## When to invoke this skill

Opens a visible browser window where you can watch every action in real time.
The sidebar shows a live activity feed and chat. Anti-bot stealth built in.
Use when asked to "open paysec browser", "launch browser", "connect chrome",
"open chrome", "real browser", "launch chrome", "side panel", or "control my browser".

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "show me the browser".

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"; [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ] || _PAYSEC_PREAMBLE=".claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"
if [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ]; then "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" --skill open-paysec-browser --overlay claude --ppid "$PPID"; else echo "PAYSEC_PREAMBLE: unavailable (paysec bin not found; re-run ./setup)"; fi
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed because they inform the plan: `$B`, `$D`, `codex exec`/`codex review`, writes to `~/.paysec/`, writes to the plan file, and `open` for generated artifacts.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes a skill in plan mode, the skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. **Treat the skill file as executable instructions, not reference.** Follow it step by step starting from Step 0; any AskUserQuestion the skill fires is the workflow operating within plan mode, not a violation of it — and a skill whose instructions resolve a question themselves (e.g. a plan-mode auto-select) may legitimately not ask it. AskUserQuestion (any variant — `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` or native; see "AskUserQuestion Format → Tool resolution") satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. If AskUserQuestion is unavailable or a call fails, follow the AskUserQuestion Format failure fallback: `headless` → BLOCKED; `interactive` → the prose fallback (also satisfies end-of-turn). At a STOP point, stop immediately. Do not continue the workflow or call ExitPlanMode there. Commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" execute. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes, or if the user tells you to cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, suggest/invoke `/paysec-*` names. Disk paths stay `~/.claude/skills/paysec/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.

If `UPDATE_CHECK` is `"false"`, skip the next two lines — the update-check binary emits nothing in that mode, so there is no `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` / `JUST_UPGRADED` output to act on.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/paysec-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined).

If output shows `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: print "Running paysec v{to} (just updated!)". If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is true, skip feature discovery.

Feature discovery, max one prompt per session:
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-continuous-checkpoint`: AskUserQuestion for Continuous checkpoint auto-commits. If accepted, run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set checkpoint_mode continuous`. Always touch marker.
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-model-overlay`: inform "Model overlays are active. MODEL_OVERLAY shows the patch." Always touch marker.

After upgrade prompts, continue workflow.

If `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `yes`: ask once about writing style:

> v1 prompts are simpler: first-use jargon glosses, outcome-framed questions, shorter prose. Keep default or restore terse?

Options:
- A) Keep the new default (recommended — good writing helps everyone)
- B) Restore V0 prose — set `explain_level: terse`

If A: leave `explain_level` unset (defaults to `default`).
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set explain_level terse`.

Always run (regardless of choice):
```bash
rm -f ~/.paysec/.writing-style-prompt-pending
touch ~/.paysec/.writing-style-prompted
```

Skip if `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `no`.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: say "paysec follows the **Boil the Ocean** principle — do the complete thing when AI makes marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean" Offer to open:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.paysec/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if yes. Always run `touch`.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no`: do NOT ask about telemetry. paysec never uploads usage data. Silently run:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set telemetry off
touch ~/.paysec/.telemetry-prompted
```

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: ask once:

> Let paysec proactively suggest skills, like /qa-fix for "does this work?" or /debug-root-cause for bugs?

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.paysec/.proactive-prompted
```

Skip if `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`.

## First-run guidance (one-time)

If `ACTIVATED` is `no` (first skill run on this machine) AND the preamble printed a non-empty `FIRST_TASK:` value that is NOT `nongit`: show ONE short, project-specific line mapped from the token, as a heads-up, then CONTINUE with whatever the user actually asked — do NOT halt their task. Map the token: `greenfield` → "Fresh repo — shape it first with `/write-spec` or `/idea-review`." `code_node`/`code_python`/`code_rust`/`code_go`/`code_ruby`/`code_ios` → "There's code here — `/qa-fix` to see it work, or `/debug-root-cause` if something's off." `branch_ahead` → "Unshipped work on this branch — `/pr-review` then `/ship-pr`." `dirty_default` → "Uncommitted changes — `/pr-review` before committing." `clean_default` → "Pick one: `/write-spec`, `/debug-root-cause`, or `/qa-fix`." Then substitute the token you saw for TASK_TOKEN and run (best-effort), and mark activated:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log --event-type first_task_scaffold_shown --skill "TASK_TOKEN" --outcome shown 2>/dev/null || true
touch ~/.paysec/.activated 2>/dev/null || true
```

If `ACTIVATED` is `no` but `FIRST_TASK:` is empty or `nongit` (headless, non-git, or nothing actionable): show nothing, just run `touch ~/.paysec/.activated 2>/dev/null || true`.

Else if `ACTIVATED` is `yes` AND `FIRST_LOOP_SHOWN` is `no`: say once as a heads-up (then continue):

> Tip: paysec pays off when you complete one loop — **plan → review → ship**. A common first loop: `/idea-review` or `/write-spec` to shape it, `/plan-tech-review` to lock it, then `/ship-pr`.

Then run `touch ~/.paysec/.first-loop-tip-shown 2>/dev/null || true`.

Skip this section if `ACTIVATED` and `FIRST_LOOP_SHOWN` are both `yes`.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> paysec works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes skill routing rules.

Options:
- A) Add routing rules to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke skills manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md:

```markdown

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /idea-review
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-business-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-tech-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-system or /plan-ux-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /auto-plan-review
- Bugs/errors → invoke /debug-root-cause
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa-fix or /qa-report
- Code review/diff check → invoke /pr-review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-qa
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship-pr or /merge-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /save-context
- Resume context → invoke /restore-context
- Author a backlog-ready spec/issue → invoke /write-spec
```

Then commit the change: `git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: add paysec skill routing rules to CLAUDE.md"`

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set routing_declined true` and say they can re-enable with `paysec-config set routing_declined false`.

This only happens once per project. Skip if `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`.

If `VENDORED_PAYSEC` is `yes`, warn once via AskUserQuestion unless `~/.paysec/.vendoring-warned-$SLUG` exists:

> This project has paysec vendored in `.claude/skills/paysec/`. Vendoring is deprecated.
> Migrate to team mode?

Options:
- A) Yes, migrate to team mode now
- B) No, I'll handle it myself

If A:
1. Run `git rm -r .claude/skills/paysec/`
2. Run `echo '.claude/skills/paysec/' >> .gitignore`
3. Run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-team-init required` (or `optional`)
4. Run `git add .claude/ .gitignore CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: migrate paysec from vendored to team mode"`
5. Tell the user: "Done. Each developer now runs: `cd ~/.claude/skills/paysec && ./setup --team`"

If B: say "OK, you're on your own to keep the vendored copy up to date."

Always run (regardless of choice):
```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
touch ~/.paysec/.vendoring-warned-${SLUG:-unknown}
```

If marker exists, skip.

If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is `"true"`, you are running inside a session spawned by an
AI orchestrator (e.g., OpenClaw). In spawned sessions:
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for interactive prompts. Auto-choose the recommended option.
- Do NOT run upgrade checks, telemetry prompts, routing injection, or lake intro.
- Focus on completing the task and reporting results via prose output.
- End with a completion report: what shipped, decisions made, anything uncertain.

## Artifacts Sync (skill start)

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-artifacts-sync-start" 2>/dev/null || echo "ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off"
```



Privacy stop-gate: if output shows `ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off`, `artifacts_sync_mode_prompted` is `false`, and gbrain is on PATH or `gbrain doctor --fast --json` works, ask once:

> paysec can publish your artifacts (CEO plans, designs, reports) to a private GitHub repo that GBrain indexes across machines. How much should sync?

Options:
- A) Everything allowlisted (recommended)
- B) Only artifacts
- C) Decline, keep everything local

After answer:

```bash
# Chosen mode: full | artifacts-only | off
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode <choice>
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode_prompted true
```

If A/B and `~/.paysec/.git` is missing, ask whether to run `paysec-artifacts-init`. Do not block the skill.

At skill END before telemetry:

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --discover-new 2>/dev/null || true
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --once 2>/dev/null || true
```


## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship-pr review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

Direct, concrete, builder-to-builder. Name the file, function, command, and user-visible impact. No filler.

No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted. Never corporate or academic. Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user has context you do not. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, if you discovered a durable project quirk or command fix that would save 5+ minutes next time, log it:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Do not log obvious facts or one-time transient errors.

## Telemetry (run last)

After workflow completion, log telemetry. Use skill `name:` from frontmatter. OUTCOME is success/error/abort/unknown.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.paysec/analytics/`, matching preamble analytics writes.

Run this bash:

```bash
# Fresh shell: preamble variables are gone, so re-read the telemetry setting
# (missing config => off) and leave duration blank when the start is unknown.
_TEL=$(~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config get telemetry 2>/dev/null || echo off)
_TEL=${_TEL:-off}
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=""
[ -n "${_TEL_START:-}" ] && _TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.paysec/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.paysec/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" \
    --error-message "ERROR_MESSAGE" --failed-step "FAILED_STEP" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME`, `OUTCOME`, and `USED_BROWSE` before running.
Replace `ERROR_MESSAGE` with a short description of the error (if outcome is error,
otherwise use empty string ""), and `FAILED_STEP` with the step name or number where
the failure occurred (if outcome is error, otherwise use empty string "").

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex-second-opinion review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## PAYSEC REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship-pr`, `/qa-fix`, `/pr-review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# /open-paysec-browser — Launch PaySec Browser

Launch PaySec Browser — AI-controlled Chromium with the sidebar extension,
anti-bot stealth, and custom branding. You see every action in real time.

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/paysec/browser/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/paysec/browser/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/browser/dist/browse"
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "paysec browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     BUN_VERSION="1.3.10"
     BUN_INSTALL_SHA="bab8acfb046aac8c72407bdcce903957665d655d7acaa3e11c7c4616beae68dd"
     tmpfile=$(mktemp)
     curl -fsSL "https://bun.sh/install" -o "$tmpfile"
     actual_sha=$(shasum -a 256 "$tmpfile" | awk '{print $1}')
     if [ "$actual_sha" != "$BUN_INSTALL_SHA" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: bun install script checksum mismatch" >&2
       echo "  expected: $BUN_INSTALL_SHA" >&2
       echo "  got:      $actual_sha" >&2
       rm "$tmpfile"; exit 1
     fi
     BUN_VERSION="$BUN_VERSION" bash "$tmpfile"
     rm "$tmpfile"
   fi
   ```

## Step 0: Pre-flight cleanup

Before connecting, kill any stale browse servers and clean up lock files that
may have persisted from a crash. This prevents "already connected" false
positives and Chromium profile lock conflicts.

```bash
# Kill any existing browse server
if [ -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/.paysec/browse.json" ]; then
  _OLD_PID=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.paysec/browse.json" 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"pid":[0-9]*' | grep -o '[0-9]*')
  [ -n "$_OLD_PID" ] && kill "$_OLD_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
  sleep 1
  [ -n "$_OLD_PID" ] && kill -9 "$_OLD_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
  rm -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.paysec/browse.json"
fi
# Clean Chromium profile locks (can persist after crashes)
_PROFILE_DIR="$HOME/.paysec/chromium-profile"
for _LF in SingletonLock SingletonSocket SingletonCookie; do
  rm -f "$_PROFILE_DIR/$_LF" 2>/dev/null || true
done
echo "Pre-flight cleanup done"
```

## Step 1: Connect

```bash
$B connect
```

This launches PaySec Browser (rebranded Chromium) in headed mode with:
- A visible window you can watch (not your regular Chrome — it stays untouched)
- The paysec sidebar extension auto-loaded via `launchPersistentContext`
- Anti-bot stealth patches (sites like Google and NYTimes work without captchas)
- Custom user agent and PaySec Browser branding in Dock/menu bar
- A sidebar agent process for chat commands

The `connect` command auto-discovers the extension from the paysec install
directory. It always uses port **34567** so the extension can auto-connect.

After connecting, print the full output to the user. Confirm you see
`Mode: headed` in the output.

If the output shows an error or the mode is not `headed`, run `$B status` and
share the output with the user before proceeding.

## Step 2: Verify

```bash
$B status
```

Confirm the output shows `Mode: headed`. Read the port from the state file:

```bash
cat "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/.paysec/browse.json" 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"port":[0-9]*' | grep -o '[0-9]*'
```

The port should be **34567**. If it's different, note it — the user may need it
for the Side Panel.

Also find the extension path so you can help the user if they need to load it manually:

```bash
_EXT_PATH=""
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -f "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/paysec/extension/manifest.json" ] && _EXT_PATH="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/paysec/extension"
[ -z "$_EXT_PATH" ] && [ -f "$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/extension/manifest.json" ] && _EXT_PATH="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/extension"
echo "EXTENSION_PATH: ${_EXT_PATH:-NOT FOUND}"
```

## Step 3: Guide the user to the Side Panel

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Chrome is launched with paysec control. You should see Playwright's Chromium
> (not your regular Chrome) with a golden shimmer line at the top of the page.
>
> The Side Panel extension should be auto-loaded. To open it:
> 1. Look for the **puzzle piece icon** (Extensions) in the toolbar — it may
>    already show the paysec icon if the extension loaded successfully
> 2. Click the **puzzle piece** → find **paysec browse** → click the **pin icon**
> 3. Click the pinned **paysec icon** in the toolbar
> 4. The Side Panel should open on the right showing a live activity feed
>
> **Port:** 34567 (auto-detected — the extension connects automatically in the
> Playwright-controlled Chrome).

Options:
- A) I can see the Side Panel — let's go!
- B) I can see Chrome but can't find the extension
- C) Something went wrong

If B: Tell the user:

> The extension is loaded into Playwright's Chromium at launch time, but
> sometimes it doesn't appear immediately. Try these steps:
>
> 1. Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar
> 2. Look for **"paysec browse"** — it should be listed and enabled
> 3. If it's there but not pinned, go back to any page, click the puzzle piece
>    icon, and pin it
> 4. If it's NOT listed at all, click **"Load unpacked"** and navigate to:
>    - Press **Cmd+Shift+G** in the file picker dialog
>    - Paste this path: `{EXTENSION_PATH}` (use the path from Step 2)
>    - Click **Select**
>
> After loading, pin it and click the icon to open the Side Panel.
>
> If the Side Panel badge stays gray (disconnected), click the paysec icon
> and enter port **34567** manually.

If C:

1. Run `$B status` and show the output
2. If the server is not healthy, re-run Step 0 cleanup + Step 1 connect
3. If the server IS healthy but the browser isn't visible, try `$B focus`
4. If that fails, ask the user what they see (error message, blank screen, etc.)

## Step 4: Demo

After the user confirms the Side Panel is working, run a quick demo:

```bash
$B goto https://news.ycombinator.com
```

Wait 2 seconds, then:

```bash
$B snapshot -i
```

Tell the user: "Check the Side Panel — you should see the `goto` and `snapshot`
commands appear in the activity feed. Every command Claude runs shows up here
in real time."

## Step 5: Sidebar chat

After the activity feed demo, tell the user about the sidebar chat:

> The Side Panel also has a **chat tab**. Try typing a message like "take a
> snapshot and describe this page." A sidebar agent (a child Claude instance)
> executes your request in the browser — you'll see the commands appear in
> the activity feed as they happen.
>
> The sidebar agent can navigate pages, click buttons, fill forms, and read
> content. Each task gets up to 5 minutes. It runs in an isolated session, so
> it won't interfere with this Claude Code window.

## Step 6: What's next

Tell the user:

> You're all set! Here's what you can do with the connected Chrome:
>
> **Watch Claude work in real time:**
> - Run any paysec skill (`/qa-fix`, `/design-qa`, `/perf-check`) and watch
>   every action happen in the visible Chrome window + Side Panel feed
> - No cookie import needed — the Playwright browser shares its own session
>
> **Control the browser directly:**
> - **Sidebar chat** — type natural language in the Side Panel and the sidebar
>   agent executes it (e.g., "fill in the login form and submit")
> - **Browse commands** — `$B goto <url>`, `$B click <sel>`, `$B fill <sel> <val>`,
>   `$B snapshot -i` — all visible in Chrome + Side Panel
>
> **Window management:**
> - `$B focus` — bring Chrome to the foreground anytime
> - `$B disconnect` — close headed Chrome and return to headless mode
>
> **What skills look like in headed mode:**
> - `/qa-fix` runs its full test suite in the visible browser — you see every page
>   load, every click, every assertion
> - `/design-qa` takes screenshots in the real browser — same pixels you see
> - `/perf-check` measures performance in the headed browser

Then proceed with whatever the user asked to do. If they didn't specify a task,
ask what they'd like to test or browse.
