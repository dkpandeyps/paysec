## When to invoke this skill

Proper 1in margins,
intelligent page breaks, page numbers, cover pages, running headers, curly
quotes and em dashes, clickable TOC, diagonal DRAFT watermark. Not a draft
artifact — a finished artifact. Use when asked to "make a PDF", "export to
PDF", "turn this markdown into a PDF", or "generate a document".

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "make this a pdf", "make it a pdf", "export to pdf", "turn this into a pdf", "turn this markdown into a pdf", "generate a pdf", "make a pdf from", "pdf this markdown".

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"; [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ] || _PAYSEC_PREAMBLE=".claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-preamble"
if [ -x "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" ]; then "$_PAYSEC_PREAMBLE" --skill md-to-pdf --overlay claude --ppid "$PPID"; else echo "PAYSEC_PREAMBLE: unavailable (paysec bin not found; re-run ./setup)"; fi
```

## MAKE-PDF SETUP (run this check BEFORE any md-to-pdf command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
P=""
[ -n "$MAKE_PDF_BIN" ] && [ -x "$MAKE_PDF_BIN" ] && P="$MAKE_PDF_BIN"
[ -z "$P" ] && [ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/paysec/md-to-pdf/dist/pdf" ] && P="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/paysec/md-to-pdf/dist/pdf"
[ -z "$P" ] && P="$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/md-to-pdf/dist/pdf"
if [ -x "$P" ]; then
  echo "MAKE_PDF_READY: $P"
  alias _p_="$P"   # shellcheck alias helper (not exported)
  export P   # available as $P in subsequent blocks within the same skill invocation
else
  echo "MAKE_PDF_NOT_AVAILABLE (run './setup' in the paysec repo to build it)"
fi
```

If `MAKE_PDF_NOT_AVAILABLE` is printed: tell the user the binary is not
built. Have them run `./setup` from the paysec repo, then retry.

If `MAKE_PDF_READY` is printed: `$P` is the binary path for the rest of
the skill. Use `$P` (not an explicit path) so the skill body stays portable.

Core commands:
- `$P generate <input.md> [output.pdf]` — render markdown to PDF (80% use case)
- `$P generate --cover --toc essay.md out.pdf` — full publication layout
- `$P generate --watermark DRAFT memo.md draft.pdf` — diagonal DRAFT watermark
- `$P preview <input.md>` — render HTML and open in browser (fast iteration)
- `$P setup` — verify browse + Chromium + pdftotext and run a smoke test
- `$P --help` — full flag reference

Output contract:
- `stdout`: ONLY the output path on success. One line.
- `stderr`: progress (`Rendering HTML... Generating PDF...`) unless `--quiet`.
- Exit 0 success / 1 bad args / 2 render error / 3 Paged.js timeout / 4 browse unavailable.

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed because they inform the plan: `$B`, `$D`, `codex exec`/`codex review`, writes to `~/.paysec/`, writes to the plan file, and `open` for generated artifacts.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes a skill in plan mode, the skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. **Treat the skill file as executable instructions, not reference.** Follow it step by step starting from Step 0; any AskUserQuestion the skill fires is the workflow operating within plan mode, not a violation of it — and a skill whose instructions resolve a question themselves (e.g. a plan-mode auto-select) may legitimately not ask it. AskUserQuestion (any variant — `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` or native; see "AskUserQuestion Format → Tool resolution") satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. If AskUserQuestion is unavailable or a call fails, follow the AskUserQuestion Format failure fallback: `headless` → BLOCKED; `interactive` → the prose fallback (also satisfies end-of-turn). At a STOP point, stop immediately. Do not continue the workflow or call ExitPlanMode there. Commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" execute. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes, or if the user tells you to cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, suggest/invoke `/paysec-*` names. Disk paths stay `~/.claude/skills/paysec/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.

If `UPDATE_CHECK` is `"false"`, skip the next two lines — the update-check binary emits nothing in that mode, so there is no `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` / `JUST_UPGRADED` output to act on.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/paysec-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined).

If output shows `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: print "Running paysec v{to} (just updated!)". If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is true, skip feature discovery.

Feature discovery, max one prompt per session:
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-continuous-checkpoint`: AskUserQuestion for Continuous checkpoint auto-commits. If accepted, run `~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set checkpoint_mode continuous`. Always touch marker.
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/paysec/.feature-prompted-model-overlay`: inform "Model overlays are active. MODEL_OVERLAY shows the patch." Always touch marker.

After upgrade prompts, continue workflow.

If `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/writing-style-migration.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/lake-intro.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no`: do NOT ask about telemetry. paysec never uploads usage data. Silently run:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config set telemetry off
touch ~/.paysec/.telemetry-prompted
```

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/proactive-prompt.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

## First-run guidance (one-time)

If `ACTIVATED` is `no` OR `FIRST_LOOP_SHOWN` is `no`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/first-run-guidance.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/routing-injection.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `VENDORED_PAYSEC` is `yes`: Read `~/.claude/skills/paysec/preamble/sections/vendoring-deprecation.md` and follow it. Otherwise skip it.

If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is `"true"`, you are running inside a session spawned by an
AI orchestrator (e.g., OpenClaw). In spawned sessions:
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for interactive prompts. Auto-choose the recommended option.
- Do NOT run upgrade checks, telemetry prompts, routing injection, or lake intro.
- Focus on completing the task and reporting results via prose output.
- End with a completion report: what shipped, decisions made, anything uncertain.

## Artifacts Sync (skill start)

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-artifacts-sync-start" 2>/dev/null || echo "ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off"
```



Privacy stop-gate: if output shows `ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off`, `artifacts_sync_mode_prompted` is `false`, and gbrain is on PATH or `gbrain doctor --fast --json` works, ask once:

> paysec can publish your artifacts (CEO plans, designs, reports) to a private GitHub repo that GBrain indexes across machines. How much should sync?

Options:
- A) Everything allowlisted (recommended)
- B) Only artifacts
- C) Decline, keep everything local

After answer:

```bash
# Chosen mode: full | artifacts-only | off
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode <choice>
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config" set artifacts_sync_mode_prompted true
```

If A/B and `~/.paysec/.git` is missing, ask whether to run `paysec-artifacts-init`. Do not block the skill.

At skill END before telemetry:

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --discover-new 2>/dev/null || true
"$HOME/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-brain-sync" --once 2>/dev/null || true
```


## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship-pr review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

Direct, concrete, builder-to-builder. Name the file, function, command, and user-visible impact. No filler.

No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted. Never corporate or academic. Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user has context you do not. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, if you discovered a durable project quirk or command fix that would save 5+ minutes next time, log it:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Do not log obvious facts or one-time transient errors.

## Telemetry (run last)

After workflow completion, log telemetry. Use skill `name:` from frontmatter. OUTCOME is success/error/abort/unknown.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.paysec/analytics/`, matching preamble analytics writes.

Run this bash:

```bash
# Fresh shell: preamble variables are gone, so re-read the telemetry setting
# (missing config => off) and leave duration blank when the start is unknown.
_TEL=$(~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-config get telemetry 2>/dev/null || echo off)
_TEL=${_TEL:-off}
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=""
[ -n "${_TEL_START:-}" ] && _TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.paysec/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.paysec/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/paysec/bin/paysec-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" \
    --error-message "ERROR_MESSAGE" --failed-step "FAILED_STEP" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME`, `OUTCOME`, and `USED_BROWSE` before running.
Replace `ERROR_MESSAGE` with a short description of the error (if outcome is error,
otherwise use empty string ""), and `FAILED_STEP` with the step name or number where
the failure occurred (if outcome is error, otherwise use empty string "").

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex-second-opinion review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## PAYSEC REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship-pr`, `/qa-fix`, `/pr-review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

# md-to-pdf: publication-quality PDFs from markdown

Turn `.md` files into PDFs that look like Faber & Faber essays: 1in margins,
left-aligned body, Helvetica throughout, curly quotes and em dashes, optional
cover page and clickable TOC, diagonal DRAFT watermark when you need it.
Copy-paste from the PDF produces clean words, never "S a i l i n g".

On Linux, install `fonts-liberation` for correct rendering — Helvetica and Arial
aren't present by default, and Liberation Sans is the standard metric-compatible
fallback. CI and Docker builds install it automatically via Dockerfile.ci.

Emoji need a color-emoji font. macOS (Apple Color Emoji) and Windows (Segoe UI
Emoji) ship one; most Linux distros and containers ship none, so emoji render as
empty boxes (▯). `./setup` auto-installs `fonts-noto-color-emoji` on Linux
(apt/dnf/pacman/apk, best-effort) and the print CSS falls back through Apple /
Segoe / Noto emoji families. Set `PAYSEC_SKIP_FONTS=1` to skip the install (CI
without sudo, managed or offline machines).

## Core patterns

### 80% case — memo/letter

One command, no flags. Gets a clean PDF with running header + page numbers
+ CONFIDENTIAL footer by default.

```bash
$P generate letter.md                 # writes /tmp/letter.pdf
$P generate letter.md letter.pdf      # explicit output path
```

### Publication mode — cover + TOC + chapter breaks

```bash
$P generate --cover --toc --author "Garry Tan" --title "On Horizons" \
  essay.md essay.pdf
```

Each top-level H1 in the markdown starts a new page. Disable with
`--no-chapter-breaks` for memos that happen to have multiple H1s.

### Draft-stage watermark

```bash
$P generate --watermark DRAFT memo.md draft.pdf
```

Diagonal 10% opacity DRAFT across every page. When the draft is final, drop
the flag and regenerate.

### Fast iteration via preview

```bash
$P preview essay.md
```

Renders HTML with the same print CSS and opens it in your browser. Refresh
as you edit the markdown. Skip the PDF round trip until you're ready.

### Brand-free (no CONFIDENTIAL footer)

```bash
$P generate --no-confidential memo.md memo.pdf
```

### Diagrams — mermaid and excalidraw fences render as pictures

A column-0 ` ```mermaid ` or ` ```excalidraw ` fence in the markdown renders
as a crisp vector diagram, fully offline (vendored bundle, no CDN). Indented
fences (inside lists) stay plain code blocks by design. A broken fence
produces a visible red diagnostic block with the parse error — never silent
raw code.

Fence info-string options:

```
```mermaid title="Auth flow"        ← caption + aria-label
```mermaid render=false             ← keep it as a code block (today's behavior)
```mermaid page=landscape           ← force this diagram onto a landscape page
```mermaid page=portrait            ← veto auto-landscape for this diagram
```

A ` ```excalidraw ` fence contains a full .excalidraw scene file (what
excalidraw.com saves). Authoring NEW diagrams from English is `/make-diagram`'s
job — it emits an editable triplet (source, .excalidraw, SVG/PNG) and pairs
with this skill: embed the `.mmd` source in your markdown, not the PNG.

### Images — scaled right, never truncated

Local images inline automatically (relative paths resolve against the
markdown file). Every image caps at the content box — zero truncation, ever.
Oversized photos downscale to print resolution (300dpi) so payloads stay
small with no visible quality loss.

Remote (http/https) images are **blocked with a visible placeholder** by
default — offline posture; pass `--allow-network` to fetch them. An image
that resolves outside the markdown's directory (even via symlink) still
inlines, but warns loudly; `--strict` makes it fatal. Files over 64MB or
non-regular files (fifos, devices) degrade to a placeholder instead of
hanging the run.

Per-image directives, written immediately after the image:

```
![chart](data.png){width=full}      ← stretch to content-box width
![chart](data.png){width=50%}       ← percentage or 3in/8cm/200px
![wide](arch.png){page=landscape}   ← give it its own landscape page
![wide](shot.png){page=portrait}    ← veto auto-landscape
```

Wide, small-text diagram images auto-promote to their own landscape page
(conservative: aspect ≥ 1.8, width over ~2.5x the content box, AND a
diagram-ish alt word — diagram/architecture/flowchart/chart/graph). The
promoted page is vertically centered. When the heuristic guesses wrong,
`{page=portrait}` vetoes it; false negatives just need `{page=landscape}`.

### Other formats — single-file HTML and Word

```bash
$P generate readme.md out.html --to html    # ONE self-contained file: inline
                                            # SVG diagrams, data-URI images,
                                            # zero network refs, screen-readable
$P generate readme.md out.docx --to docx    # Word: content fidelity (headings,
                                            # tables, code, diagrams as PNG) —
                                            # layout is Word's, not ours
```

`--to` is the output format. `--format` is something else entirely (a
`--page-size` alias) — don't confuse them.

### CI mode — fail loud on missing assets

```bash
$P generate docs.md --strict     # missing, remote, out-of-tree, oversized,
                                 # and non-regular-file images exit non-zero
                                 # instead of warn + placeholder
```

## Common flags

```
Page layout:
  --margins <dim>            1in (default) | 72pt | 2.54cm | 25mm
  --page-size letter|a4|legal

Structure:
  --cover                    Cover page (title, author, date, hairline rule)
  --toc                      Clickable TOC with page numbers
  --no-chapter-breaks        Don't start a new page at every H1

Branding:
  --watermark <text>         Diagonal watermark ("DRAFT", "CONFIDENTIAL")
  --header-template <html>   Custom running header
  --footer-template <html>   Custom footer (mutex with --page-numbers)
  --no-confidential          Suppress the CONFIDENTIAL right-footer

Output:
  --to pdf|html|docx         Output format (default: pdf). html = single
                             self-contained file; docx = content fidelity.
  --strict                   Missing, remote, out-of-tree, oversized, or
                             non-regular-file images fail the run (CI mode).
  --page-numbers             "N of M" footer (default on)
  --tagged                   Accessible PDF (default on)
  --outline                  PDF bookmarks from headings (default on)
  --quiet                    Suppress progress on stderr
  --verbose                  Per-stage timings

Network:
  --allow-network            Fetch external images. Off by default: remote
                             images render as a visible blocked placeholder
                             (no tracking pixels fetch at print time).

Metadata:
  --title "..."              Document title (defaults to first H1)
  --author "..."             Author for cover + PDF metadata
  --date "..."               Date for cover (defaults to today)
```

## When Claude should run it

Watch for markdown-to-PDF intent. Any of these patterns → run `$P generate`:

- "Can you make this markdown a PDF"
- "Export it as a PDF"
- "Turn this letter into a PDF"
- "I need a PDF of the essay"
- "Print this as a PDF for me"

If the user has a `.md` file open and says "make it look nice", propose
`$P generate --cover --toc` and ask before running.

## Debugging

- Output looks empty / blank → check browse daemon is running: `$B status`.
- Fragmented text on copy-paste → highlight.js output (Phase 4). Retry with
  `--no-syntax` once that flag exists. For now, remove fenced code blocks
  and regenerate.
- Paged.js timeout → probably no headings in the markdown. Drop `--toc`.
- "[remote image blocked]" placeholder in the output → add `--allow-network`
  (understand you're giving the markdown file permission to fetch from its
  image URLs).
- Generated PDF too tall/wide → `--page-size a4` or `--margins 0.75in`.

## Output contract

```
stdout: /tmp/letter.pdf          ← just the path, one line
stderr: Rendering HTML...        ← progress spinner (unless --quiet)
        Generating PDF...
        Done in 1.5s. 43 words · 22KB · /tmp/letter.pdf

exit code: 0 success / 1 bad args / 2 render error / 3 Paged.js timeout
           / 4 browse unavailable
```

Capture the path: `PDF=$($P generate letter.md)` — then use `$PDF`.
